I still think it could be quite  \r\nuseful to write this posts in english (u know, i'm not a native speaker).  \r\nWell, this post will probably be not that so informative, but any way let's write it.\r\n\r\nTo make your *.so*-object executable you need simply do the following :\r\n* Define a path to your system ld-linux.so\r\n* Target an entry point of your library with -Wl,-e\r\n\r\nThis simple code (let's call it executable_so) do the job\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n\r\nconst char interp[] __attribute__((section(\".interp\"))) = \"path-to-your-ld-linux.so\"\r\n\r\nvoid entry()\r\n{\r\n    _exit(0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOften ld-linux could be found at */lib*\r\n\r\nNext you should compile it with\r\n\r\n```makefile\r\ngcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o test.so executable_so.c -lc -Wl,-e,entry\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it - first simple post here about boring stuff, which could be useful  \r\none day.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
